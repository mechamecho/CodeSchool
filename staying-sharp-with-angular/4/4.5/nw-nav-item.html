<!--We can see in the index.html that we're already passing Notes and Users to the name attribute of our nav item directive. Use data binding to display the value of name as the content of our a tag.-->
<!--Give each nwNavItem a class of active if it isActive()-->
<!--On click, call the activate() method.-->
<!--Create an href for each nav item with a dynamic path using the name variable. The route should look like: #/value_of_name and use data binding-->
<!--Notice that routes are case sensitive. When we click on Users, it finds no route for /Users, and therefore redirects to /notes. Solve this issue by using a lowercase filter on the name binding within the route.-->
<!--Since we've added an expression to the href attribute of our a tag, we need to change it to ng-href attribute. Check out the docs to see why this is important.-->
<a class="list-item" ng-class="{'active': isActive()}" ng-href="#/{{name|lowercase}}"
   ng-click="activate()"> {{name}} </a>
